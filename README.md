Automated Code Review System
Overview
The Automated Code Review System is a project aimed at developing an intelligent system capable of automatically reviewing code submissions and providing feedback to developers. This system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various aspects of code quality, including errors, accuracy, security vulnerabilities, and more.
Our model is a basic classification model which classifies the code based on relevance and reliability using the algorithm logistic regreesion which is a supervised ML algorithm.
Dataset source:
As this dataset was not available in any platform, we created our own datasets and manipulated them for better efficiency.
We performed feature engineering to drastically improve its performance
Hence the future scope of the model is to integrate the model with a runtime compiler for making it user-friendly.
To conclude, we are committed to continuous improvement and innovation in the field of automatic code analysis to help developers and organizations achieve better performance, productivity and code quality in software development. Integrated pipeline for seamless code review.
